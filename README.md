Monitor Progress and Status of Training Institute, Pre-Schools etc.


I have used jQuery, Ajax, javaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3 for the front-end and Php and mySQL Database at backend.
I did not use any API for graph, rather I have used CSS and Php/mySQL query to show Graphical presentation and I have not copied from anywhere. These are my own idea and my own code.
